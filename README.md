## Bank Marketing Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit with a bank. The project is built with Python 3.8 and uses various data analysis and machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains data from a bank's marketing campaign. The data includes client demographics, previous marketing campaign information, and other variables. The dataset can be found in the data folder.

### Getting Started

1 Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

2 Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook bank-marketing-analysis.ipynb

The Jupyter notebook contains the main code for the project, including data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. The notebook also includes visualizations and performance metrics for the models used.
